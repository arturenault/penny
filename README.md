# Penny

This is an application that allows people to get anonymous feedback from other users.
In other words, get a "penny for their thoughts."

I'm just learning Rails, so this was built with the guidance of the [*Ruby on Rails Tutorial*](http://railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/). Guess I now owe him a beer.
